setRequiredNumber:

Input space: 0 <= nemployee and 0 <= starttime and 0 <= endtime

Partition #1: nemployee = 0 and starttime > endtime
test_m_part1: input: "nemployee = 0, starttime = 1, endtime = 0", expected: the schedule is unchanged

Partition #2: nemployee = 0 and starttime = endtime
test_m_part2: input: "nemployee = 0, starttime = 0, endtime = 0", expected: requiredNumber is set to nemployee AND workingEmployees keeps a number of employees equal to nemployee, discarding the rest AND the rest of the schedule is unchanged

Partition #3: nemployee = 0 and starttime < endtime
test_m_part3: input: "nemployee = 0, starttime = 0, endtime = 1", expected: requiredNumber is set to nemployee AND workingEmployees keeps a number of employees equal to nemployee, discarding the rest AND the rest of the schedule is unchanged

Partition #4: nemployee >= 1 and starttime > endtime
test_m_part4: input: "nemployee = 2, starttime = 1, endtime = 0", expected: the schedule is unchanged

Partition #5: nemployee >= 1 and starttime = endtime
test_m_part5: input: "nemployee = 2, starttime = 0, endtime = 0", expected: requiredNumber is set to nemployee AND workingEmployees is unchanged AND the rest of the schedule is unchanged

Partition #6: nemployee >= 1 and starttime < endtime
test_m_part6: input: "nemployee = 2, starttime = 0, endtime = 1", expected: requiredNumber is set to nemployee AND workingEmployees is unchanged AND the rest of the schedule is unchanged

Border cases:
test_m_border1: input: "nemployee = 0,       starttime = MAX_INT, endtime = 0",       expected: "requiredNumber unchanged"
test_m_border2: input: "nemployee = 0,       starttime = MAX_INT, endtime = MAX_INT", expected: "requiredNumber unchanged"

Found bugs: ???.



nextIncomplete:

Input space: currenttime >= 0 and currenttime < size

Partition #1: currenttime = 0
test_m_part1: input: "currenttime = 0", expected: "?"

Partition #2: currenttime >= 1 and currenttime < size
test_m_part2: input: "currenttime = 5", expected: "?"

Border cases:
test_m_border1: input: "currenttime = MAX_INT", expected: "?"

Found bugs: ???.

Frågor:

Vad är workingEnployees och size? Ska vi anta något nummer?
Vad händer vid loopar med MAX_INT?
Är testet 0, 0, 0 samma som testet nemployee = 0, starttime = endtime
Vad menas med "Implement at least one test case"?
